1.1

This document is intended to provide a detailed overview of the specific requirements of the LABCAFE project, which is being carried out as part of the course Information Systems Development. The aim of the project is to allow students to apply the theoretical knowledge they have gained during their bachelor's studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and Informatics at Comenius University during the years 2022–2025. The requirements catalog serves as a communication tool among all the stakeholders of the project, ensuring that everyone clearly understands the system’s functionality, objectives, and value. This document provides a detailed overview of the project scope, its expected features, user requirements, and technical specifications.

The developed information system is designed to manage access control and order processing for LabCafe and its technical infrastructure.
Its core function is to facilitate communication between the Otello system and various devices, such as 3D printers, locks, and access modules. Through integration with the Fabman database, the system enables the administrator to oversee member access to both the workshop and equipment, while also managing and tracking 3D printing tasks.
Furthermore, the system incorporates POS terminal capabilities to monitor café purchases made by members, utilizing card-based authentication and synchronizing data via platforms like PapayaPOS and Airtable. This solution streamlines member management, access control, and the tracking of equipment usage within LabCafe.
