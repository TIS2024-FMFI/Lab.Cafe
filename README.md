# Lab.Cafe

Application for Registration and Access Maintenance to Devices in Lab.Cafe FabLab

### Description
Lab.Cafe is a caf√© with 3D printers, where customers can bring their ideas to life. Our responsibility was to enhance the website, which manages the status of the 3D printers and stores payments.
